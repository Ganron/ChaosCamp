Homework repository associated with the ChaosCamp Ray Tracing course.

### Homework 2 - Basic image creation
  - Problem 1: A grid of squares with varying brightness and a pixelated Lemniscate on top of it.
  - Problem 2: A solid Quadrifolium shape.

### Homework 3 - Camera rays
 - Problem 1: Render an image map 'displaying' the calculated normalized camera rays through each pixel.

### Homework 4 - Triangle
 - Problem 1: Add a triangle representation to a previous homework project.
 - Problem 2: Cross product
 - Problem 3: Find normal vector and area of a triangle

### Homework 5 - Ray-Triangle intersection
 - Problem 1: Render a triangle (given)
 - Problem 2: Render a triangle by choice
 - Problem 3: Render a scene of two triangles
 - Problem 4: Create a complex scene composed of triangles - we create a "beehive" of triangles which - when appropriately coloured - effectively simulates a composition of 3D cubes.

### Homework 6 - Camera movement
 - Problem 1: Implement camera pan of the forward vector.
 - Problem 2: Generate a picture of the given triangle with arbitrary camera position and orientation.
 - Problem 3: Implement some more diverse camera movements (dolly, truck, pedestal, etc.)
 - Problem 4: Generate a picture where the camera has gone through a composite transformation.
 - Problem 5: Generate a short animation (succession of frames).

### Homework 7 - Scene file import
 - Problems 1 - 5: Render a scene from the given file.
